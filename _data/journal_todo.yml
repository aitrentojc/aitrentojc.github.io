  abstract: "While instance-level explanation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is a well-studied problem with plenty of 
  approaches being developed, providing a global explanation for the behaviour of a GNN is much less explored, despite 
  its potential in interpretability and debugging. Existing solutions either simply list local explanations for a given 
  class, or generate a synthetic prototypical graph with maximal score for a given class, completely missing any 
  combinatorial aspect that the GNN could have learned. In the work that will be presented, we propose GLGExplainer 
  (Global Logic-based GNN Explainer), the first Global Explainer capable of generating explanations as arbitrary Boolean 
  combinations of learned graphical concepts."
