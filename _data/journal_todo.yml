  abstract: "Neural architectures can leverage relative representations to guarantee, in practice, invariance to latent isometries and rescalings, effectively enabling latent space communication: from zero-shot model stitching to latent space comparison between diverse settings, architectures, and data modalities. Moreover, an optimization-based method is introduced to discover new parallel anchors from a limited number of seeds, allowing for the discovery of unknown semantic correspondences between different domains, alignment of their relative spaces, and achieving competitive results in several tasks."
