  abstract: "Nowadays conversational systems work quite well when it comes to solve specific tasks, such as restaurant bookings or train ticket purchasing. 
  A problem that every such system has to face, however, is what happens when the world changes, so that the task-specific domain is modified: a restaurant adds a new type of food, a new train station is added, etc. 
  This work demonstrates how the models of a dialogue system degrade their performances in a situation of changes, and proposes some solutions for overcoming this problem."
