  abstract: "Autonomous vehicles promise to revolutionize society and improve the daily life of many. After decades of 
  slow-paced progress, recent advances in AI are bringing this promise close to reality more than ever. However, 
  the reality we are witnessing is not as bright as expected. It is becoming evident that autonomous vehicles are 
  incapable of the complex reasoning necessary for driving, in situations where humans are still far more performing. 
  That is why we are exploring new methods beyond the classic engineering approach, by looking for inspiration from the 
  only existing intelligent being able to drive: the human. Cognitive mechanisms and brain components involved in 
  driving can inspire new approaches with the potential to finally shorten the gap between artificial drivers and human drivers."
